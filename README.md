# XWE #

This repo contains the Delphi program, XWE, for Doom.  If you are a Doom hacker it is still useful.

The author quit updating the app and released the source under the GPL on 05/09.  Sadly, almost all mirrors were dead.

## Running ##

The compiled `xwe.exe` was checked in.  It doesn't work in modern Windows unless you run in XP SP2 compatibility mode.

## Initial Version ##

This is an import of the last version, 1.6.

## Plans ##

The importer of this tree has no plans to maintain this codebase.  However, he will accept patches from other users.
